//! Shared plan-applicability contract for placement planners that can refuse
//! to apply an unsafe or useless plan rather than silently executing it.
//!
//! A planner accumulates blocking reasons as it checks a plan (out-of-bounds
//! targets, a score that does not improve, …); `status()` reports
//! `"applicable"` only when none were found. The same shape is meant for
//! every planner that can produce a plan a caller should not blindly apply
//! (decoupling placement first; force-directed refinement is expected to
//! adopt it next) so callers learn one contract, not one per tool.
